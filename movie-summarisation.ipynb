SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR OF HIGH-RISE - NIGHT\\n\\nTYLER has the barrel of a HANDGUN lodged in JACK\\'S MOUTH.  They\\nstruggle intensely.\\n\\nThey are both around 30; Tyler is blond, handsome, eyes burning with\\nfrightening intensity; and JACK, brunette, is appealing in a dry sort\\nof way.  They are both sweating and disheveled; Jack seems to be losing\\nhis will to fight.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          We won\\'t really die.  We\\'ll be immortal.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          oor -- ee-ee --uh -- aa-i --\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          With a gun barrel between your teeth, you speak only in vowels.\\n\\nJack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.\\n\\nJACK (still distorted)\\nYou\\'re thinking of vampires.\\n\\nJack tries to get the gun.  Tyler keeps control.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          With my tongue, I can feel the silencer holes drilled into the barrel\\n          of the gun.  Most of the noise a gunshot makes is expanding gases.  I\\n          totally forgot about Tyler\\'s whole murder-suicide thing for a second\\n          and I wondered how clean the gun barrel was.\\n\\nTyler checks his watch.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          Three minutes.\\n\\nJack turns so that he can see down -- 71 STORIES.\\n\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          The building we\\'re standing won\\'t be here in three minutes.  You take a\\n          98-percent concentration of fuming nitric acid and add three times as\\n          much sulfuric in a bathtub full of ice.  Then, glycerin drop-by-drop. \\n          Nitroglycerin.  I know this because Tyler knows this.\\n\\nJack manages to SHOVE Tyler away.  Then, he leaps onto him and they\\nfall onto a table, then roll off onto the floor.  The gun falls and\\nslides.  They wrestle with each other, then dash for the gun.  Tyler\\ngets there first and grabs the gun.  DURING THE ABOVE:\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation\\n          columns of this building with blasting gelatin.  The primary charge\\n          will blow the base charge, and this spot Tyler and I are standing on\\n          will be a point in the sky.\\n\\nTyler drags Jack back to the glass wall and forces him to look out at\\nthe city skyline.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          This is our world now.  Two minutes.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          Two minutes to go and I\\'m wondering how I got here.\\n\\nMOVE IN ON JACK\\'S FACE.\\n\\nSLOWLY PULL BACK from Jack\\'s face.  It\\'s pressed against TWO LARGE\\nBREASTS that belong to ... BOB, a big moose of a man, around 35 years\\nold.  Jack is engulfed by Bob\\'s arms in an embrace.  Bob weeps openly. \\nHis shoulders inhale themselves up in a long draw, then drop, drop,\\ndrop in jerking sobs.  Jack gives Bob some squeezes in return, but his\\nface is stone.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          Bob had bitch tits.\\n\\n\\nPULL BACK TO WIDE ON\\n\\nINT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT\\n\\nAll the men are paired off, hugging each other, talking in emotional\\ntones.  Some pairs lean forward, heads pressed ear-to-ear, the way\\nwrestlers stand, locked.  Near the door a temporary sign on a stand:\\n\"REMAINING MEN TOGETHER\".\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big\\n          moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.\\n\\nBOB\\nI owned my own gym.  I did product endorsements.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          You were a six-time champion.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          Bob, the big cheesebread.  Always told me his life story.\\n\\n                    BOB\\n          We\\'re still men.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Yes.  We\\'re men.  Men is what we are.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          Bob cried.  Six months ago, his testicles were removed.  Then hormone\\n          therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high\\n          and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into\\n          his sweating tits that hang enormous, the way we think of God\\'s as big.\\n\\nBob hugs tighter, then looks with empathy into Jack\\'s eyes.\\n\\n                    BOB\\n          Maybe it\\'s just seminoma.  With seminoma, you have a hundred percent\\n          survival rate.\\n\\nThe Leader steps forward and signals everyone.\\n\\n                    LEADER\\n          Okay.  Group hug.\\n\\n\\nEveryone converges into a cluster with arms thrown around shoulders,\\nmaking a big mass of sobbing, smiling goodwill.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          No.  Wait.  Back up.  Let me start earlier.\\n\\nINT. JACK\\'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\\n\\nJack lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.  He hears VOICES from beyond\\nthe wall.  A FLY buzzes over his face.  He swats at it, missing.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          For six months.  I couldn\\'t sleep.\\n\\nINT. DOCTOR\\'S OFFICE - DAY\\n\\nJack, eyes puffy, face pale, sits before the Doctor, who studies him\\nwith bemusement.\\n\\n                    DOCTOR\\n          No, you can\\'t die of insomnia.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Maybe I already died.  Look at my face.\\n\\n                    DOCTOR\\n          You need to lighten up.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Can you give me something?\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          Little red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.\\n\\nDOCTOR (overlapping w/ above)\\nYou need healthy, natural sleep.  Chew valerian root and get more\\nexercise.\\n\\nThe Doctor ushers Jack to the door.  They step into the\\n\\nINT. HALLWAY\\n\\nWhere the Doctor starts moving away from Jack, picking up a chart on a\\ndoor.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          I\\'m in pain.\\n\\n\\nDOCTOR (facetious)\\nYou want to see pain?  Swing by Meyer High on a Tuesday night and see\\nthe guys with testicular cancer.\\n\\nThe Doctor moves into the other room.  Jack stares after him somberly. \\nMOVE IN ON JACK\\'S FACE.\\n\\nPULL BACK TO WIDE ON:\\n\\nINT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT\\n\\nJack stares at a group of men, including Bob, who are all listening to\\na group member speak at a lectern.  The speaker has death-white skin\\nand sunken eyes -- he\\'s clearly dying.\\n\\nSPEAKER\\nI ... wanted to have three kids.  Two boys and a girl.  Mindy wanted\\ntwo girls and one boy.  We never agreed on anything.\\n\\nThe Speaker cracks a sad smile.  Some men chuckle, happy to lighten the\\nmood.\\n\\n                    SPEAKER\\n          Well ... she had her first girl a month ago ... with her new husband. \\n          Thank God, because she deserves ...\\n\\nThe speaker breaks down and WEEPS UNCONTROLLABLY.  Jack is riveted.  He\\nbarely breathes.  CUT TO:\\n\\nINT. GYM - LATER\\n\\nA Leader herds people into pairing-off.\\n\\n                    LEADER\\n          Find a partner.\\n\\nBob starts toward Jack, shuffling his feet.  Jack watches him, still\\nmoved by his experience, face full of intense empathy.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          The big moosie, his eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.  Knees\\n          together, invisible steps.\\n\\nBob takes Jack into an embrace.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          He pancaked down on top of me.\\n\\n\\n                    BOB\\n          Two grown kids ... and they won\\'t return my calls.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one.\\n\\nJack\\'s face is rapt and sincere.  Bob stops talking and breaks into\\nsobbing, putting his head down on Jack\\'s shoulder and completely\\ncovering Jack\\'s face.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          Then, I was lost in oblivion -- dark and silent and complete.\\n\\nJack\\'s body begins to jerk in sobs.  He tightens his arms around Bob.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          This was freedom.  Losing all hope was freedom.\\n\\nJack pulls back from Bob.  On Bob\\'s chest, there\\'s a WET MASK of Jack\\'s\\nface from how he looked weeping.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          Babies don\\'t sleep this well.\\n\\nINT.

OFFICE BUILDING BASEMENT - NIGHT\\n\\nJack pulls back from a group hug of more sickly people.  They pair-off.\\n\\nJack stands with a weeping middle-aged WOMAN.  He gingerly takes her in\\nhis arms, pats her back.  He begins to cry along with her.  In view is\\na sign by the door:  \"Onward and Upward\".\\n\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          If I didn\\'t say anything, people assumed the worst.  They cried harder.\\n I cried harder.\\n\\nINT. CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL - NIGHT\\n\\nJack is in an embrace with a YOUNG MAN.  They are both weeping.\\n\\nJACK (V.O.)\\nI wasn\\'t really dying.  I wasn\\'t host to cancer or parasites; no, I was\\nthe warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.\\n\\nINT. PUBLIC BUILDING CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT\\n\\nEveryone settles in their seats and a Leader takes the microphone.\\n\\n                    LEADER\\n          Okay, everyone, close your eyes.

ENTRANCE OF CAVE (JACK\\'S IMAGINATION)\\n\\nJack walks up to the entrance and out comes a PENGUIN.  The penguin\\nlooks at him, smiles.\\n\\n                    PENGUIN\\n          Slide.\\n\\nEXT.

Being\\n          there, my face against his tits, getting ready to cry -- this was my\\n          vacation.\\n\\nMARLA SINGER enters.  She has short matte black hair and big, dark eyes\\nlike a character from Japanese animation.\\n\\n                    MARLA\\n          This is cancer, right?\\n\\nShe raises a cigarette to her lips.

Marla Singer... did not have testicular cancer.  She\\n          had no diseases.  She was a liar.  I saw her at \"We Shall Overcome,\" my\\n          melanoma group Monday night ...\\n\\nINT.

Jack squeezes out a laugh.  Then, he\\nsees Marla, off by herself.  Someone is heading for her.  Most people\\nhave paired-off.  Jack gives a quick nod to Chloe and darts for Marla,\\ngrabbing her.

If people think you\\'re dying, they really listen, instead of just\\nwaiting for their turn to speak.  Everything else about credit card\\ndebts and sad radio songs and thinning hair goes out the window.\\n\\n                    MARLA\\n          It started with a lump.  I went to a breast cancer support group.  The\\n          lump turned out benign.  But I still needed my Monday fix.  So, I went\\n          to lymphoma, just to check it out.

Turning on a light meant\\n          that another light in the house went out.  The stairs were ready to\\n          collapse.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nEXT. CONVENIENCE STORE PARKING LOT - NIGHT\\n\\nLONG SHOT - ZOOMING OUT - Resuming from previous shot, getting further\\naway, but now with TEN GUYS around two guys fighting.  CUT TO:\\n\\nINT. SHOWER - MORNING\\n\\nJack, showing some new bruises, with even fatter knuckles, turns on the\\nwater.  LOUD VIBRATION  from the walls.  Water spits in starts, then\\ndribbles out.  CUT TO:\\n\\nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING\\n\\nTyler, in a nice suit, checks over the bars of soap in his briefcase,\\nthen shuts it.  Jack walks in, dressed in his work clothes.  He picks\\nup a battered old saucepan with boiling coal-black coffee and sips.  He\\noffers it to Tyler, who sips.  Jack pulls a TOOTH out of his mouth and\\nthrows it into the sink.  They both walk out the door.\\n\\nEXT. CINEMA PARKING LOT - NIGHT\\n\\nLONG SHOT - ZOOMING OUT - Resuming from previous shot, getting further\\naway, but now with FOURTEEN GUYS around a fight.  CUT TO:\\n\\nEXT. PORCH - NIGHT\\n\\nTyler, in his waiter uniform, sits next to Jack on the lip of the\\nporch.  They both have newer, different bruises and cuts, sit and\\nguzzle beer.  THUNDERCLAPS.  RAIN begins to fall.  Tyler gets to his\\nfeet.\\n\\nINT. BASEMENT - SAME\\n\\nTyler and Jack are knee-deep in water, standing by a FUSEBOX.  Tyler\\nopens it.  He grabs two breaker switches, waits for Jack.  Jack grabs\\ntwo other switches,  apparently, they have to do this in a certain\\norder.  Tyler flips his switches, then Jack flips his.  CUT TO:\\n\\nEXT. CONSTRUCTION AREA - NIGHT\\n\\nLONG SHOT - ZOOMING OUT - Resuming from previous shot, getting further\\naway, but now with EIGHTEEN GUYS around a fight.  CUT TO:\\n\\n\\nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\\n\\nRain DRIPS from the ceiling -- some of it from LIGHT FIXTURES.  Tyler\\nand Jack enter with LIT CANDLES.  They sit down on the decrepit,\\nbuckled wood floor.  There\\'s not one item of furniture in the room. \\nThere are, however, THOUSANDS of MAGAZINES.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          The previous occupant collected magazines.\\n\\nThey each pick up an opened magazine and resume reading, adjusting\\nclose to the candles.\\n\\nTyler lies down next to him, setting his candle next to Jack\\'s.  Tyler\\npicks up a magazine.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          What are your reading?\\n\\nJACK\\n\"I Am Joe\\'s Lungs\".  It\\'s written in first person.  \"Without me, Joe\\ncould not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells\".\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          Sounds fascinating.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          It\\'s a whole series -- \"I Am Joe\\'s Prostate\".\\n\\nTYLER\\n\"I get cancer, and I kill Joe\".\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          What are you reading?\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          Soldier of Fortune,  National Geographic.  New Republic.  Forbes.\\n\\n                    JACK \\n          Show-off.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          Every Wednesday night, after fighting like wild animals, we were too\\n          wired to go to sleep.\\n\\n\\nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY\\n\\nIn near DARKNESS as a SLIDE SHOW progresses, run by a chipper salesman,\\nWALTER.  Jack sits, deadpan, with a PUFFY LIP and a BRUISE on his\\ncheek.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          Thursday morning, my Boss didn\\'t know what to think.\\n\\nBoss blocks him from the rest of the room, gives him a dubious look,\\nturns back to Walter.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          And all I could do was think about next week.\\n\\nWalter advances to the next slide, showing a view of a COMPUTER SCREEN.\\n\\n                    WALTER\\n          The basic premise of microsofting your office is -- make things more\\n          efficient.\\n\\nAs Walter continues, his sales pitched gets drowned out by Jack\\'s\\nnarration:\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          Walter, the Microsoft account exec, smiled at me with his steam shovel\\n          jaw.  Walter, with his smooth, soft hands.  Here he was, doing his cute\\n          little show.  Maybe thinking about a free-range potluck he\\'d been to\\n          last weekend, but probably not.\\n\\nWalter moves to Jack and slaps his shoulder.\\n\\nWALTER\\nI showed this already to my man here.  You liked it, didn\\'t you?\\n\\nSlowly, Jack smiles.  His teeth are RED with BLOOD.  They GLOW eerily\\nin the dim light.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          You can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick.\\n\\n                    WALTER\\n          Jeez, I\\'d hate to see what happened to the other guy.\\n\\nJack keeps the smile frozen on his face.\\n\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          Fuck Walter.  His candy ass wouldn\\'t last a second in fight club.\\n\\nEXT. LOU\\'S TAVERN - NIGHT\\nOut of silent darkness, HEADLIGHTS appear from all directions.  A\\nsynchronous WAVE of cars PULLS UP and parks in the already-filled lot. \\nYoung men get out of the arriving cars and wander into the tavern.  We\\nrecognize, among them, the GUYS who watched Tyler and Jack\\'s *first\\nfight*.\\n\\nINT. LOU\\'S TAVERN - SAME\\n\\nThe men enter; the bartender, IRVINE, calls out:\\n\\n                    IRVINE\\n          Drink up people.  We\\'re closing.  Let\\'s go.\\n\\nThe crowd consists of men and women YUPPIES: blue collar REGULARS\\ndressed in work clothes or like cowboys; floozy barfly WOMEN.  MUSIC\\nplays from the jukebox.\\n\\nThe arriving men simply wait.  And wait.  Tyler and Jack enter.  They,\\ntoo, stand back against he wall.\\n\\nThe waiting army begins to share secret looks and grins.  A certain\\nlevel of eagerness can be seen among them.\\n\\nIrvine looks at Jack and grins.  He flips on LIGHTS.  The drunken\\ncustomers squint and get the message.  They gulp down their drinks,\\nplop down money and filter out the door.  Irvine hits a button and the\\njukebox loses  power -- the record simply turns slower until it stops\\nrevolving.\\n\\nFinally, the last of the irritated customers leaves.  One guy locks the\\ndoor.  Two other guys pull down blinds.  Someone else moves over to the\\nBASEMENT DOOR and opens it.\\n\\nINT. BASEMENT STEPS - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nThe grinning men march down steps; CHATTER begins.\\n\\nTALL GUY\\nI brought my roommate tonight.  Phil.\\n\\n                    FAT GUY\\n          Oh, yeah?  Hi, Phil.\\n\\n                    TALL GUY\\n          He kept seeing what I looked like.  Had to check it out.\\n\\n\\nINT. TAVERN BASEMENT - SAME\\n\\nA BOMB-SHELTER -- concrete floor, concrete walls.  One BARE LIGHT BULB\\nhangs by a wire from the ceiling.  Tyler nods to Jack and Jack turns on\\nthe light.  The guys mill around, finding partners.  The whole mood is\\nvery friendly.  Everyone brims with eagerness, but tries to act cool\\nabout it.  CHATTER gets LOUDER.\\n\\nFAT GUY\\nA mean uppercut.\\n\\nWIRY GUY\\nI gotta work on my left.\\n\\n                    SHORT GUY\\n          *He\\'s* got a left.\\n\\n                    FAT GUY\\n          Hey, you\\'re wiping the floor with dudes who are way out of your weight\\n          class.\\n\\nTALL GUY (slapping Wiry Guy\\'s shoulder)\\nSkinny guys.  They fight till they\\'re burger.\\n\\nPEAKING CHATTER, then -- Tyler moves into position directly under the\\nlight bulb.  His face is partially in shadow.\\n\\nEveryone spreads out, forming a circle, the light bulb for a center. \\nTyler\\'s will WIPES through the room and the CHATTER DIES.  A couple of\\nCOUGHS, FEET SHUFFLING.  Then, SILENCE.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          The first rule of fight club is -- you don\\'t talk about fight club. \\n          The second rule of fight club is -- you don\\'t talk about fight club.\\n\\nJack glances over at a short guy, RICKY, with a BLACK EYE.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          This kid, Ricky -- supply clerk -- he can\\'t remember whether you\\n          ordered pens with blue ink or black ink ...\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          The third rule in fight club is -- when someone says \"stop\" or goes\\n          limp, the fight is over.  The fourth rule is -- only two guys to a\\n          fight.\\n\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          But Ricky was a god for ten minutes when he trounced an actuary twice\\n          his size.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          Fifth rule -- one fight at a time.  Sixth rule -- no shirts or shoes. \\n          Seventh rule -- fights go on as long as they have to.  And the eighth\\n          rule of fight club is -- if this is your first night, you *have* to\\n          fight.\\n\\nTyler steps back, and a FAT MAN and a GOATEED MAN take off their shirts\\nand shoes and step into the center.  They circle each other, then begin\\nthrowing punches.  SWEAT flies into the moist air.  SHOUTS become\\nDEAFENING.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          Sometimes you could hear flat, hard packing sounds over all the yelling\\n          as someone caught his breath and sprayed:\\n\\n                    GOATEED MAN\\n          Ssstop.\\n\\nINT. OFFICE PARK RESTAURANT - DAY\\n\\nJack, eating lunch, is served a refill soda by the BROKEN-NOSED WAITER\\nwith a GOATEE, the man from the above fight.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          Even if I could tell someone they had a good fight, I wouldn\\'t be\\n          talking to the same man.  Who you were in fight club is not who you\\n          were in the rest of your world.  You weren\\'t alive anywhere like you\\n          were alive at fight club.  But fight club only exists in the hours\\n          between when fight club starts and when fight club ends.\\n\\nINT. JACK\\'S OFFICE - DAY\\n\\nBoss, passing by the doorway, looks in at Jack with irritated wonder. \\nJack, playing solitaire on his computer, daubs blood from his mouth\\nwith a handkerchief.\\n\\n                    BOSS\\n          What are you getting yourself into every week?\\n\\n\\nJack flashes a smile at Boss.  Boss shakes his head, walks away.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          After a night in fight club, everything else in your life gets the\\n          volume turned down.  You can deal with anything.  All the people who\\n          used to have power over you have less and less.\\n\\nReflexively, Jack\\'s tongue plays with his teeth.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          By this point, I could wiggle most of the teeth in my jaw.\\n\\nINT. BUS - DAY\\n\\nJack stands, holding a hand grip.  An arrogant MAN in a three-piece\\nsuit brushes past him, knockng his shoulder.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          We all started to size people up.\\n\\nJack violently knocks the Man\\'s shoulder in return.  The Man turns and\\nhe and Jack face each other for a brief moment.  Jack\\'s face is stone.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          I\\'d look at some asshole and *know* I could beat him.\\n\\nThe arrogant Man continues down the aisle.  Jack notices a GUY with\\nSMASHED LIP.  The Guy grins, giving a slight nod.\\n\\nINT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY (FLASHBACK)\\n\\nJack walks past the parking garage.  He sees a VALET who has facial\\nbruises.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          We were all doing it.\\n\\nThe Valet and Jack share a quick smile.  A BMW pulls up and HONKS at\\nthe Bruised Valet. The bruised Valet has no reaction as a FAT EXEC gets\\nout of his car and tosses the keys.  Jack watches the Bruised Valet\\nsize up the Exec, then hop into the car and loudly PEEL OUT.\\n\\n\\nJACK (V.O.)\\nI would see them all the time -- fight club members looking at other\\nguys, knowing they could kick their asses.\\n\\nINT. TAVERN BASEMENT - NIGHT\\n\\nJack lands a couple of jabs to HIS OPPONENT\\'S stomach, then brings up a\\nleft uppercut that smashes the Opponent\\'s jaw.  Tiny spatters of BLOOD\\nadorn the walls, along with sweat.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          Fight club was not about winning or losing.  It wasn\\'t about words.\\n\\nThe Opponent recovers, throws a headlock on Jack.  Jack snakes his arm\\ninto a counter headlock.  They, wrestling like wild animals.  The crowd\\nCHEERS maniacally.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          The hysterical shouting was in tongues, like at a Pentecostal church.\\n\\nThe onlookers kneel to stay with the fight, cheering ever louder.  The\\nOpponent smashes Jack\\'s head into the floor, over and over.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Stop.\\n\\nEveryone moves in as the Opponent steps away.  They lift Jack to his\\nfeet.  On the floor is a BLOOD MASK of Jack\\'s face -- similar to his\\nTEAR MASK on BOB\\'S SHIRT, seen earlier.  Tyler pushes through the\\ncrowd.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          Cool.\\n\\nEXT. BAR - NIGHT\\n\\nEveryone files out of the bar, sweating, bleeding, smiling.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          Afterwards, we all felt saved.\\n\\n\\nEXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT\\n\\nJack and Tyler walk through the pools of light cast by streetlamps. \\nThey both drip blood and sport bruises.  They each carry a 4x4 piece of\\nWOOD.  As they pass parked cars, they SLAM the sticks against the front\\nbumpers, setting off the ALARMS and causing the AIR BAGS to INFLATE.\\n\\nThey come to a bus stop that has a large display ad for jeans.  It has\\na photo of a shirtless man.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          Is that what a man looks like?\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Isn\\'t it?\\n\\nTyler smears blood on the ad.  They continue on their way.  Tyler comes\\nto a \"ROAD WORK\" sign.  Tyler kicks it into a deep HOLE.  He and Jack\\ntightrope-walk on wooden beams over darkness.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          Guys packing into the gyms, all trying to look like what Calvin Klein\\n          says.  Fight club isn\\'t about looking good.\\n\\nAs they step back onto solid pavement, Tyler kicks one of the beams,\\ncausing it to come loose and fall.  The whole temporary work structure\\nfalls into the hole.  Tyler and Jack continue walking.  IN the\\nbackground, a car SKIDS and FISHTAILS, avoiding the hole.\\n\\nSound of a SIREN getting closer.  Tyler hands Jack the 4x4 and runs,\\nlaughing.  Jack stands there a moment, then throws the stick and runs\\nafter Tyler.\\n\\nJACK (V.O.)\\nA guy comes to fight club for the first time, and his ass is a wad of\\ncookie dough.  After a few weeks, he looks carved out of wood.  He\\ntrusts himself to handle anything.\\n\\nEXT. ANOTHER STREET - CONTINUOUS\\n\\nJack and Tyler, panting, sweat mixing with blood, slow down and resume\\nwalking.  Tyler pulls his fingers, popping them -- his knuckles are\\nswollen.  He grins at the pain.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          Self-improvement is masturbaation.  Self-destruction is the answer.\\n\\n\\nINT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON\\n\\nThe PHONE RINGS.  Jack enters from the living room, buttoning his\\nshirt.  He answers.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Hello?\\n\\nINTERCUT WITH\\n\\nINT. MARLA\\'S ROOM - SAME\\n\\nShe lies on the bed, twisting the phone cord around her neck like a\\nnoose.\\n\\n                    MARLA\\n          Where have you been the last few weeks?\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Marla?\\n\\nMARLA\\nI haven\\'t seen you at any support groups.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          That\\'s the idea -- we split them.\\n\\n                    MARLA \\n          You haven\\'t been going to yours.\\n\\nJACK\\nI found a new one.\\n\\n                    MARLA\\n          Really?

Look, this is a bad time.\\n\\nMARLA\\nI started going to debtor\\'s anonymous.

I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what\\n          was left of the bottle.  Might\\'ve been too much ... probably was.\\n\\nJack turns TO CAMERA.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          Picture yourself watching Marla throw herself around her crummy\\n          apartment, saying, \"I\\'m dying.  Dying.  Dying.  It could go on for\\n          hours.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          You probably want to die in peace.  I\\'ll let you go.\\n\\n                    MARLA\\n          Stay on the line.  I want you to hear me describe death.\\n\\nJack puts the handset on top of the phone, still off the hook, and\\nwalks out of the kitchen.\\n\\nMARLA\\'S VOICE\\nI want to see if my spirit can use the telephone.\\n\\nINT. BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT\\n\\nGRUNTS of PLEASURE and EXERTION.  In dim light, we get glimpses of\\nTORSOS, ASSES, LEGS, ARMS, BREASTS, and BLACK FEMALE HAIR -- all\\nDRENECHED in SWEAT.  Sheets RIP.  CA-CHUNK! CA-CHUNK! Bodies hit the\\nFLOOR and roll.  More insane GRUNTING.  And LAUGHING -- CACKLING.  A\\nflash of MARLA\\'S FACE.  Then, groans of ecstasy approaching climax. \\nCUT TO:\\n\\nINT. JACK\\'S BEDROOM - SUNRISE\\n\\nJack sits up in bed, looks around the room.\\n\\nINT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING\\n\\nJack steps out of his room, looks down to the next door -- the door is\\nclosed.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          Tyler\\'s door was closed.  I\\'d been living here a month, and Tyler\\'s\\n          door never closed.\\n\\n\\nINT. BATHROOM - SAME\\n\\nJack stares into the toilet.  CLOSE UP - SIX USED CONDOMS IN TOILET.\\n\\nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING\\n\\nJack sits at the table, sipping coffee, reading Reader\\'s Digest.  He\\ntakes in a long yawn, rubs his eyes.  He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          You\\'re not going to believe the dream I had.\\n\\nMarla walks in, straightening her dress.  She looks like she\\'s been\\nraped by a hurricane.  Some of her hair is matted against her head,\\nsome of it is sticking out wildly.  Jack gapes at her in shock.  She\\ncracks a coy smile and runs a finger across the back of his neck.\\n\\nMARLA\\nI can hardly believe *anything* about last night.\\n\\nShe pours herself a cup of coffee.  She takes a big gulp, GARGLES and\\nSPITS it out into the sink.  She gives Jack a lascivious smile.  Then,\\nshe sips from the cup.  She strokes his hair.  He pulls back from her.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          What the fuck are you doing here?!\\n\\nMarla looks at him a beat, then throws the cup into the sink and it\\nSHATTERS.\\n\\n                    MARLA\\n          Fuck you.\\n\\nShe kicks open the door to the backyard and walks out.  Jack watches\\nher stomp across the lawn to the sidewalk and down the street.\\n\\nJack turns and -- Tyler is at his shoulder, staring after Marla.  He\\'s\\nin his usual sweatpants.  He grins at Jack, then moves away, pours\\nhimself coffee.  Jack, smoldering, slumps at the table and picks up\\nReader\\'s Digest.  Tyler puts his foot on a countertop and begins to do\\nstretching exercises.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          That crazy bitch almost fucked me in half.

Before\\nhe can knock, Marla\\'s hand shoots out and grabs Tyler\\'s arm.\\n\\nINT. MARLA\\'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)\\n\\nMarla pulls Tyler inside and shuts the door.

STREET - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nJack walks down the sidewalk.  He glances back up at Marla\\'s window as\\nhe crosses the street.  He sees her.  She moves away from the window\\nand -- Jack\\'s BUMPED -- very lightly -- by a PASSERBY -- it\\'s *Tyler*.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          What are you doing?\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Uh ...

BOSS\\'S OFFICE - DAY\\n\\nJack steps into the open doorway and lightly knocks against the frame. \\nBoss looks up from his large, expensive desk.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          We need to talk.\\n\\n\\n                    BOSS\\n          Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your\\n          unpresentable appearance?  I might as well tell you now -- you\\'re going\\n          to be put up for review.\\n\\nThis next line *NOT* in V.O.:\\n\\nJACK\\nI Am Joe\\'s Complete Lack Of Surprise.\\n\\nBoss sits up in his seat, becoming enraged.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Let\\'s pretend.  You\\'re the Department of Transportation.  And you knew\\n          that our company intentionally left a front seat mounting bracket that\\n          never passed collision tests?  Did nothing about leather seats -- that\\n          were cured in third world countries with a chemical we know causes\\n          birth defects?  Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  \\n          Turbochargers that blow up and cut off legs at the knees.  Fuel\\n          injectors that burn people alive.  All of these accidents where \"cause\\n          of failure\" is stamped \"unknown\".  I know where the bodies are buried. \\n          Call it job security.\\n\\n                    BOSS\\n          Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out of here!  You\\'re\\n          fired!\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          I\\'ve got a better idea.  You\\'re going to keep me on payroll as an\\n          outside consultant.  In exchange for my salary, I\\'ll perform the task\\n          of not telling anyone what I know.  I won\\'t need to come into the\\n          office.  I can do this job from home.  Call it early retirement, with\\n          pension.\\n\\nBoss stands, moves around his desk, glaring with rage.\\n\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Yes, I am shit and crazy, to you and this whole fucking world, but I\\'m\\n          your responsibility.\\n\\nJack PUNCHES HIMSELF in the nose.  Blood starts to trickle down.  He\\npunches himself in the jaw, harder.  He throws himself back, acting as\\nif the force of the punch knocked him.  His back SLAMS against a framed\\npainting and SHATTERS the glass.  He and the frame and the glass and\\nthe painting fall to the floor.\\n\\nJACK (V.O.)\\nI Am Joe\\'s Smirking Revenge.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Please don\\'t hit me again.  Please.\\n\\nJack gets back to his feet and punches himself in the stomach, then\\npunches himself in the jaw again.  He reels backwards and falls into a\\nhanging shelf, ripping it off the wall, sending it\\'s contents flying. \\nHe falls to the floor again.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          For some reason, I thought of my first fight -- with Tyler.\\n\\nJack crawls along the carpet toward Boss, dripping blood.  He tries to\\nkeep up the act, but he sporadically GIGGLES.  He grabs Boss\\'s leg.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Please ... give me the paychecks like I asked for.  You won\\'t see me\\n          again.  You won\\'t have any trouble.\\n\\nJack climbs up Boss\\'s leg.  Boss, aghast, tries to shake him off, and,\\nin doing so, stumbles back in to his desk, knocking off photos, stacks\\nof paper, paperweights.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          Under and behind and inside everything this man took for granted,\\n          something horrible had been growing.\\n\\nJack crawls up high enough to grab Boss\\'s belt and hoist himself up\\nfurther.  He\\'s getting blood all over the Boss\\'s clothes.  Jack SMUDGES\\nblood from his face onto the knuckles of both Boss\\'s hands.  The\\nhorrified man SCREAMS.\\n\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          And right then, at our most excellent moment, security guards decided\\n          to walk in.\\n\\nTwo SECURITY GUARDS come inside and gape at the sight.  Behind them\\nstands a crowd of curious workers, also taking in the sight.\\n\\nJACK (gurgling blood)\\nPlease don\\'t hit me again.\\n\\nINT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - JACK\\'S ROOM - DUSK\\n\\nJack, all bloody, lies in his bed, asleep.  He awakens, hearing the\\nBACK DOOR SLAM.  He painfully hauls himself out of bed.\\n\\nINT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nJack enters to see Tyler taking beers out of the fridge.  Jack waves a\\nPAYCHECK.\\n\\nJACK\\nI did it.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          That\\'s fucking great!\\n\\nJack sees that Tyler is dressed in combat fatigues.  He\\'s splattered\\nwith various colors of PAINT.  There\\'s a rope and rappelling mechanisms\\nlying on the table.\\n\\nTyler nods toward the living room and hands Jack all the beers.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          Go on in.  We\\'re celebrating.\\n\\nINT. LIVING ROOM\\n\\nJack, a little bewildered, saunters in, carrying the beers.  Tyler does\\nNOT follow him.  Bob, Ricky and several fight club guys are in front of\\nthe TV.  They are all dressed like Tyler, all splattered with paint.\\n\\nJack hands them their beer.  One of the guys is sixteen year old with\\nan angelic face.  He notices the TV.\\n\\nANGEL FACE\\nSHHH!  They\\'re back to it!\\n\\n\\nJack looks at the TV as it shows a LIVE shot of a BUILDING, which is\\nidentified at the bottom of the screen as the TRW building.  It has a\\nGIANT GRINNING FACE PAINTED on it.  The two EYES are broken, charred\\nwindows with SMOKE pouring out.  Firetrucks spray water into the\\nwindows.\\n\\n                    REPORTER\\n          Police Commissioner Jacobs has come down ... just a second ... excuse\\n          me, could you tell us what you think this is?\\n\\nThe COMMISSIONER JACOBS, a wrinkled man with baleful eyes, turns to\\ncamera.\\n\\n                    COMMISSIONER JACOBS\\n          We believe this is related to the other recent acts of vandalism around\\n          the city.  It\\'s some kind of organized group.  And we\\'re investigating\\n          thoroughly.\\n\\nJack turns back and sees Tyler in the archway, watching the TV.  Tyler\\npulls back, out of sight.  Jack turns to the others.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          What did you guys do?\\n\\nThey all BURST INTO LAUGHTER, look at Jack and shake their heads.  Jack\\njust stares at them.  Suddenly, the guys\\' faces turn to stone.\\n\\n                    BOB\\n          The first rule of Project Mayhem is -- you don\\'t ask questions.\\n\\nJack stares at them.  CUT TO:\\n\\nINT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT\\n\\nA loud, luxurious banquet ensues.  Commissioner Jacobs guzzles\\nchampagne and puffs on a cigar.  Jack, in a waiter\\'s uniform, serving\\nanother table, stares at Jacobs.  Then, Jack looks apprehensively\\ntoward certain other waiters:  Tyler, Bob, Ricky and Angel Face --\\nmixed in with the mass of waiters.\\n\\nINT. BATHROOM - SAME\\n\\nCommissioner Jacobs enters, puffing the cigar, and walks toward a\\nurinal.  Jack, Tyler, Bob and Ricky leap out of the corner and attack\\nhim.  Jack\\'s heart isn\\'t in it -- he barely helps the others.  Tyler\\nknocks the cigar out of Jacob\\'s mouth and slaps a piece of tape over\\nit.\\n\\n\\nINT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - SAME\\n\\nJack holds the door while the others drag the struggling Commissioner\\ninside.  They hold him down and pull down his pants.  Bob snaps a\\nrubber band, then reaches down to Commissioner Jacob\\'s crotch.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          Wrap it around the top of his ball sac.\\n\\nRicky holds a knife to Commissioner Jacob\\'s testicles.  Jack,\\nred-faced, keeps his distance.  Tyler leans in and whispers in the\\nfrightened man\\'s ear.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          You\\'re not going to continue your \"rigorous investigation\".  You\\'re\\n          going to publicly state that there is no underground group.  Or --\\n          imagine, the rest of your life with your ball sac flapping empty.\\n\\n                    COMMISSIONER JACOBS\\n          No.  Please.  Stop.  Please.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          One to the *New York Times* and one to the *Los Angeles Times*.  Press\\n          release style.  Remember this.

So don\\'t fuck with us.\\n\\nRicky makes a dramatic cut with the knife -- he holds up the severed\\nRUBBER BAND.\\n\\nEXT. HOTEL - LATER\\n\\nJack, Tyler and the others file quickly out the back service entrance. \\nTyler slaps Angel Face\\'s back.  Angel Face smiles at him.  Everyone\\nsplits up in different directions.\\n\\n\\nINT. BASEMENT - NIGHT\\n\\nFight club in full swing.  Jack squares off with Angel Face.  He BEATS\\nthe SHIT out of Angel Face with a viciousness heretofore unseen.  The\\ncrowd shouts maniacally, save for Tyler, who watches with an\\ninscrutable stone face.\\n\\nAngel Face tries to speak, but Jack pounds him too hard.  Blood flies\\neverywhere.  The crowd becomes QUIETER.  Finally, Angel Face, on the\\nfloor, is clearly unconscious.  Jack stops, stares at him, numb.  The\\ncrowd seems a little spooked.  Tyler scans the faces, looks at Jack.\\n\\nEXT. STREET - LATER\\n\\nTyler and Jack walk through pools of streetlight.\\n\\nJACK\\nI felt like destroying something beautiful.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          Excellent.\\n\\nAn idling car HONKS.

STOLEN CAR - MOVING - LATER\\n\\nRAIN GUSHES down.  Tyler drives.  Jack sits slumped in the passenger\\nseat.  They are BARRELING down a two-lane HIGHWAY, intermittently\\nilluminated by oncoming headlights.  Jack stews in silence.  Tyler\\nglances at him.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          What\\'s the problem?\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Nothing.  Why wasn\\'t I told about \"Project Mayhem\"?\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          You *were* told about it.\\n\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Fine.

That Project Mayhem will knock over the\\n          pillars of civilization like dominoes?  That it\\'s going to bring about\\n          a prematurely-induced dark age?  Should I E-mail you?  Should I put\\n          this on your \"action item list\"?\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Fine.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          Recognize the make and model of this car?\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Yeah -- so what?\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          The front seat mounting bracket never passed collision tests.\\n\\nTyler pulls the car into the opposite lane.  HEADLIGHTS in the distance\\nget closer very, very quickly.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          What are you doing?!\\n\\nThe oncoming car gets closer and closer, honking and flashing it\\'s\\nlights.  Jack tries to grab the wheel.  Tyler uses one arm to pin down\\nJack\\'s arms.  He uses one hand to steer.\\n\\nJACK\\nTYLER!  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!!\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?\\n\\nJACK\\nI WOULD FEEL NOTHING ABOUT MY LIFE!

Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I\\'m sick of\\n          this shit!  How\\'s that?  Huh?\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          You don\\'t have any concept of what it is to hit bottom.\\n\\nAn oncoming TRUCK honks and flashes it\\'s lights.  It moves to the other\\nside of the road.  Tyler steers there, too.  The truck moves back;\\nTyler moves back.  More honking and flashing.  The truck moves; Tyler\\nmoves.\\n\\nTYLER\\nHITTING BOTTOM ISN\\'T A WEEKEND RETREAT!  IT\\'S NOT A SEMINAR!  ONLY\\nAFTER YOU\\'VE LOST EVERYTHING ARE YOU FREE TO DO ANYTHING!  YOU SEE, YOU\\nLISTEN, BUT YOU DON\\'T GET IT!  YOU HAVE TO FORGET EVERYTHING YOU KNOW,\\nEVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW!\\n\\nJust seconds to impact with the oncoming truck and -- Tyler swerves. \\nNow the car heads straight for a STALLED CAR on the side of the road,\\nsurrounded by flares.  Jack stops struggling to get his arms free.\\n\\nJACK\\nI am nothing in the world compared to you.  I am helpless.  I am stupid\\nand weak and all I do is want and need things.  I *am* my little shit\\njob.  I *am* my condo and my Swedish furniture.  I am SHIT!\\n\\nTyler lets go of Jack\\'s arms and lets go of the steering wheel.  He and\\nJack look at each other as their car barrels toward the stalled car. \\nTheir faces are illuminated by the light of the flares.\\n\\nThey SMASH into the stalled car.  Both airbags inflate, but the front\\nseat LURCHES forward, loose, causing the men\\'s legs to bang against the\\ndash.  Tremendous momentum makes the back of the car whip around and\\ncarry it into a ass-over-teakettle ROLL down the hill.\\n\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          I\\'d never been in a car accident.

FAMILY CAR (JACK\\'S IMAGINATION)\\n\\nThe car that Jack saw, post-wreck, in the warehouse, FLAMING, tumbling\\nEND over END; the FATHER, MOTHER TEENAGE GIRL and BABY all SCREAMING.\\n\\nINT. TYLER\\'S STOLEN CAR - RESUMING\\n\\nThe hill goes on further and further -- it\\'s a deep RAVINE.  The car\\nfinally hits the bottom, lying on its roof.\\n\\nEXT. OVERTURNED CAR\\n\\nTyler crawls out and goes around, opening Jack\\'s door.  He drags Jack\\nout into the mud.  He grabs Jack\\'s face and squeezes it, shaking it.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          You just had a near-life experience.\\n\\nINT. JACK\\'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT\\n\\nJack lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.  Tyler sits in a chair, next\\nto the bed, speaking softly.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          The world I see -- you\\'re stalking elk through the damp canyon forests\\n          around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.  You wear leather clothes that\\n          will last you the rest of your life.  You climb the wrist-thick vines\\n          that wrap the Sears Tower.  You see tiny figures pounding corn and\\n          laying strips of venison on the empty car pool lane of the ruins of a\\n          superhighway.\\n\\nINT. JACK\\'S BEDROOM - DAWN\\n\\nJack lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.  Tyler is gone.  Faint sounds\\nof SAWING and HAMMERING.\\n\\n\\nINT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nJack sits at the table, sipping coffee.  He\\'s pale, dazed.  He seems\\nbroken.  He hears the faint sounds of sawing and hammering again; he\\'s\\nunsure of where they\\'re coming from.  He glances out the window, sees\\nnothing.\\n\\nMarla walks into the kitchen.  Jack looks up at her.  She looks at him,\\nunsmiling.  There\\'s a bruise on her face and arm.  She pours herself a\\ncoffee and lights a cigarette.  A beat of silence, then:\\n\\n                    MARLA\\n          I\\'ll be out of your way in a sec.\\n\\nShe seems to be as weak as Jack.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          You ... don\\'t have to ... rush off.\\n\\n                    MARLA\\n          Sarcastic prick.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          No, really ...\\n\\nMarla\\'s eyes drift away from his.  Jack gets up, tries to move closer\\nto her.  She pulls away.  He retreats and they wind up on opposite\\nsides of the room.  Jack leans against the wall near the BASEMENT DOOR,\\nwhich is AJAR.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Why are we both ... caught up like this ... with ...?\\n\\nJACK (V.O.)\\nI came so close to saying Tyler\\'s name, I could feel it vibrate inside\\nmy mouth.\\n\\nMarla looks at him curiously, waiting.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Why does a weak person go out and find a strong person to ... hang\\n          onto?\\n\\n                    MARLA\\n          It\\'s a real sick relationship.

LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nJack opens the door.  Ricky stands on the porch, staring blankly ahead\\nin subordinate military style.  He\\'s dressed in black pants, black\\nshirt, black shoes.  He holds a brown paper bag.  An army surplus\\nmattress sits in a tied-up roll at his feet.\\n\\nJack is about to say something, when Tyler steps past Jack and speaks\\nvery softly to Ricky:\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          I\\'m sorry.  You\\'re too young to train here.\\n\\nTyler steps back inside and shuts the door.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          \"Train\" here?\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          He\\'s not.  If the applicant is young, we tell him he\\'s too young.  Old,\\n          too old.  Fat, too fat.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Why?\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          This is how Buddhist temples tested applicants going back for\\n          bah-zillion years.

GET OUT!\\n\\nIt\\'s clear there will be no response from Ricky, who\\'s like a statue. \\nJack goes back inside, closes the door.\\n\\nEXT. PORCH - NIGHT\\n\\nRicky stands in the same spot.  Jack bursts out with a broom, knocks\\nthe brown paper bag out of Ricky\\'s hand, kicks it off the porch.  Ricky\\nremains in place, motionless.\\n\\nJACK\\nARE YOU STUPID?!  I TOLD YOU TO GET OUT OF HERE!  YOU\\'RE NEVER GETTING\\nINSIDE THIS HOUSE!\\n\\nEXT. PORCH - MORNING\\n\\nRicky in the same spot.  Tyler slinks out the front door, smiling.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          I\\'m sorry about the misunderstanding.  Look, friend, it\\'s not the end\\n          of the world.

JACK\\'S ROOM - LATER\\n\\nJack drinks a beer, smokes a cigarette and stares down at the PORCH,\\nwhich he can see from a sideward//downward angle.  Ricky stands in the\\nsame spot.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          Sooner or later, we all just became what Tyler wanted us to be.\\n\\n\\nEXT. PORCH - MORNING\\n\\nRicky\\'s in the same spot.  Next to him now is Bob, dressed in black\\nwith brown paper bag and Army surplus mattress.  Tyler steps out the\\nfront door.  Jack lights in the doorway, locking eyes on Bob.\\n\\nTYLER (to Ricky)\\nGet your stuff.\\n(to Bob)\\nYou\\'re too old to train here.  Sorry.\\n\\nTyler and Ricky go inside and Tyler slams the door.\\n\\nINT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - LATER\\n\\nJack stands in the open bathroom doorway, watching Tyler SHAVE off all\\nof Ricky\\'s HAIR.  When he\\'s done, Tyler gives the top of Ricky\\'s head a\\nsharp slap.\\n\\nTYLER\\nA monkey, ready to be shot up into space, ready to sacrifice himself\\nfor Project Mayhem.\\n\\nAnd, so, all those with shaved heads will henceforth be termed \"SPACE\\nMONKEYS\".\\n\\nEXT.

LIVING ROOM - SAME\\n\\nJack pulls back from the window.  SPACE MONKEYS, all dressed in black,\\nall with shaved heads, are ALL OVER THE PLACE.  There are tables set up\\nfor them to wrap bars of soap.  Jack lopes into the \\n\\nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS\\n\\nWhere Space Monkeys render fat and make soap.  Several, off to the\\nside, stir a large vat of RICE.  One of them recites a memorized\\nstatement:\\n\\n                    FRECKLED SPACE MONKEY\\n          \"You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake.

I could get hit by lightning and my head could burn\\n          down to a smoldering baseball and my zipper could weld shut.\\n\\nHe moves back out to the\\n\\nINT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\\n\\nAnd tromps up the steps to the 2nd floor landing.\\n\\nINT. TYLER\\'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS\\n\\nJack enters.  Bob reads a book and makes marks on a chart.  All along\\nthe floor are baskets; each one is labeled with a number in sequence:\\n\"1, 2,\" etc.  The first ten are under a sign that says \"WILMINGTON\". \\nThen, there\\'s a sign over some that says \"NEW YORK\", then \"CHICAGO\",\\nand other cities.  There are dozens of BOOKS on FINANCE.  Jack looks in\\nbasket number \"1\" and sees the word \"CITIBANK\" at the top of a page. \\nHe starts flipping through it; then the next basket.\\n\\nBob grabs Jack\\'s hand and leads him away from the baskets.\\n\\n                    BOB\\n          The first rule of Project Mayhem is you don\\'t ask questions.\\n\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          This is me, Bob.  Tyler\\'s been gone for over a week.

KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nJack barges in among the laboring Space Monkeys.  They pinch herbs into\\nthe soap mix.  They also use vodka.  Jack grabs a bottle of vodka and\\ntakes a long pull off it.\\n\\nJACK (V.O.)\\nI had to hug the walls, being a mouse trapped inside this clockwork of\\nspace monkeys, cooking and working and sleeping in teams.  The house\\nbecame a living thing, wet on the inside from so many people sweating\\nand breathing.  So many people moving, the house moved.\\n\\nThe PHONE RINGS.  Jack snatches it.  All the Monkeys stare at him.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Project Mayhem.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\'S VOICE\\n          Don\\'t answer the phone like that.\\n\\nJack turns away from the others, moves to a corner, talks sotto voce.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Tyler!  Where have you been?\\n\\n                    TYLER\\'S VOICE\\n          Don\\'t ask questions.\\n\\nThere\\'s a tense pause.\\n\\nJACK (V.O.)\\nI Am Joe\\'s Broken Heart because Tyler dumped me.

FRONT PORCH - LATER\\n\\nJack, Bob, and two other Space Monkeys step out the front door, laden\\nwith boxes and equipment.\\n\\n                    SKINNY SPACE MONKEY\\n          \"We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world\".\\n\\nThe group of four steps off the porch and heads for a VAN.\\n\\nEXT. PARK - NIGHT\\n\\nA piece of ART adorns the top of a hill: a metal TOWER, wide at the\\nbase and a hundred feet high, in design somewhat similar to the Eifel\\nTower.  At the top is a giant GLOBE made of circular poles and wires.\\n\\nJack, Bob and the other two monkeys attach the explosive packets to the\\nglobe; wire the packets together; use sandbags to cover the packets.\\n\\nEXT. PARK - LATER\\n\\nThe group of four huddle behind some bushes, staring at the globe.  Bob\\nholds a small metal electronic box with a button -- a detonator.  He\\npresses the button.\\n\\nA RAPID SERIES of EXPLOSIONS runs from the base of the tower to the\\ntop, along the four main structural supports.  They are contained,\\nshaped blasts.  The tower crumbles straight down.  Bob turns to smile\\nat Jack.\\n\\n                    BOB\\n          Exactly the way it was supposed to work.\\n\\n\\nThe globe falls free, bangs into the top of the hill and begins to\\nroll.  When it gets to the street, it bounces onto the top of a parked\\nLIMO -- and becomes a FLAMING, raised \"GUTTERBALL\" -- it never hits the\\nstreet -- it rolls over one parked limo or expensive luxury car after\\nanother, crunching the roofs, causing the windows to explode outward. \\nFifty cars get this treatment.\\n\\nThen, it arrives at the lobby of a HOTEL, BROADSIDES a couple of limos,\\nCAROMS off them, TURNS and rolls directly into the front of a large\\n(closed) STARBUCKS, SMASHING DOWN the windows and the front door and\\nsetting the place ON FIRE.\\n\\nEXT. PARK - AERIAL VIEW\\n\\nAs Jack, Bob and the two other Monkeys FLEE, LAUGHING hysterically at\\ntheir handiwork.  They split up and move in different directions.\\n\\nMOVE IN ON JACK, sprinting, keeping hidden by bushes.  SIRENS can be\\nheard.  He\\'s stripping off his ski mask, his gloves, his combat gear --\\nas he runs.  Underneath are street clothes.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          In that moment I \"clicked\".  I became what Tyler wanted.  I was his\\n          limb, his appendage -- an extension of his will, nothing more.  And he\\n          knew it.  I could feel him knowing it.\\n\\nJack dumps the wad of clothes into a trashcan and pulls up the\\nsurrounding trash to cover them.  He breaks into a sprint again,\\nheading for the edge of the park.\\n\\nGUNSHOT.  Jack\\'s smile fades.  He stops, looks toward the direction\\nfrom which the sound came.  He turns, heads down along a row of hedges.\\n He comes to a \\n\\nINT. CONCRETE STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS\\n\\nAnd moves to the top step, looking down.  A COP is near the bottom,\\nrunning down to the sidewalk.  Next to a STREETLAMP LIES a ONE of the\\nMONKEYS in full combat attire and ski mask.  The body is MOTIONLESS,\\nSPRAWLED.  In the hand is the DETONATOR -- looking somewhat like a gun.\\n The Cop pulls off the ski mask, revealing the DEAD FACE of Bob, a\\nBULLETHOLE through the head.\\n\\nJack flinches backwards as if punched in the stomach.  He gasps for\\nbreath.  The Cop looks up and catches sight of Jack.  He lifts his gun\\nand his PB radio.  Jack jerks back out of sight.\\n\\n\\nEXT. PARK - CONTINUOUS\\n\\nJack hobbles along.  Nearby, from beyond a hedge, he hears the\\ncrackling of a PB with a VOICE coming from it.  Then:\\n\\nCOP\\'S VOICE (into PB)\\nYeah.  We found some clothes.\\n\\nJack, sweating like a pig, picks up his pace and heads for the edge of\\nthe park.\\n\\nEXT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - NIGHT\\n\\nJack, panting, white as a ghost, trembling, approaches from the\\nsidewalk.  He sees the front door open and four Space Monkeys come out,\\ncarrying LUGGAGE.\\n\\nBIG-EARED MONKEY (a solemn chant)\\nWe are now the ...\\n\\nOTHER MONKEYS & BIG-EARED (unison)\\n... right hands of Tyler Durden.\\n\\nJack steps up onto the porch and sees that they are all holding FLIGHT\\nCOUPONS.  Jack notices that all of them have the KISS-SCAR on their\\nleft hands.  They ignore him with military demeanor and walk down to\\nthe sidewalk and head for the bus stop.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          Under and behind and inside everything I took for granted, something\\n          horrible had been growing.\\n\\nINT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\\n\\nJack walks inside to see a Space Monkey, BEET-RED but silent, holding\\nout his hands while LYE BURNS the inside of the TOPS of his FINGERS. \\nOther Monkeys sit and await the process.\\n\\n                    JACK (V.O.)\\n          They were using lye to burn off their fingerprints.\\n\\nINT. TYLER\\'S ROOM\\n\\nJack barges into the room, goes to the desk and rifles through drawers.\\n His elbow bangs against the top of an ANSWERING MACHINE.  It plays\\nMESSAGES.\\n\\n\\n                    MARLA\\'S VOICE\\n          Look, don\\'t get bent, okay?  But ... there\\'s a therapist that I think\\n          could really help you.

I\\'ve called four times in\\n          the last two days.  I need you to come in for some further questioning.\\n\\nJack shivers, snaps OFF the machine, then more furiously continues his\\nsearch.  He finally finds flight coupons -- both used and unused.  The\\nused ones have the flight information, including the destination\\ncities.  He stuffs all of them into his pocket.\\n\\nCLOSE SHOT:  SIGN:  \"LAGUARDIA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT\".\\n\\nINT. BAR - NIGHT\\n\\nJack walks in and sees several MALE PATRONS with FIGHT BRUISES.

You couldn\\'t even figure this out.  It\\'s\\n          been staring you in the face for months.  I had to drop my busy\\n          schedule and come here and tell you.  How are you going to fuck with\\n          me?  You think there\\'s any possibility that I haven\\'t prepared for?

He endures her baleful\\ngaze for a beat.\\n\\n                    MARLA\\n          Your whacked-out, bald feaks threw me out of the house.  I thought they\\n          were going to kill me.

They and the\\nsheets and covers SLIDE OFF onto the floor.  Jack keeps his composure\\nand looks into her eyes.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Tyler is my split personality.\\n\\n\\n                    MARLA\\n          Then, who are you?\\n\\nJack takes out his wallet, shows Marla his driver\\'s license.\\n\\n                    MARLA\\n          You gave me a fake name?

WELL,\\n*HERE\\'S* OUR FUCKING TALK!!!\\n\\nJack\\'s eyes well up with tears.  He turns away from her.  Marla\\'s face\\nsoftens.

Instead of\\n          me.  Sexually.\\n\\nMARLA\\nI ... uh ... I don\\'t know what to say -- *you\\'re* Tyler.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Okay, however you want to say it -- the abusive side of me -- the\\n          asshole who treated  you like shit and made you leave in the morning.\\n\\n\\n                    MARLA\\n          What do you want?

AND\\n          YOU *KNOW IT*!!!\\n\\nJack touches her face and she slaps his hand away.  He sighs and gets\\nto his feet.  He pulls out an airline FLIGHT COUPON and shows it to\\nher.\\n\\nJACK\\nI want you to get out of town for awhile.  Whether you believe me or\\nnot, you\\'re in *real* danger.  Is there someplace you can go?\\n\\nMarla grabs the flight coupon, looks it over.\\n\\n                    MARLA\\n          There\\'s plenty of places I\\'d like to go.\\n\\nJack digs into his pocket and produces a wad of cash.  Marla roughly\\nseizes the cash, checks out the amount.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Leave as soon as possible.  Go to a rural little town, away from any\\n          major city.

He gawks\\nat the bathtub and canisters that hold vast amounts of liquid.  He sees\\nbottles labeled \"nitric acid\".  He TIP-TOES to the\\n\\nINT. KITCHEN\\n\\nAnd picks up the phone.

Dim light from a single bulb\\noverhead creates the tone of a torture chamber.  Cigarette smoke\\nbecomes thick.  Jack sighs with relief.  It\\'s finally over.  The\\nDetectives all stare harshly at Jack.\\n\\nThen, they all BURST into HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER.  They slap and punch\\nJack\\'s shoulder.\\n\\n                    DETECTIVE STERN\\n          Very good, Mr. Durden.\\n\\nJack uses all his strength to stifle his utter shock.

Ten minutes.\\n\\nJack stalks back toward Tyler, gun raised.\\n\\n\\nJACK\\nTELL ME WHERE THE CHARGES ARE!\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          They\\'re all up and down the building.  They\\'re not just here.  If you\\n          tried to stupidly pull a fuse on a charge, you\\'d just cause it to blow\\n          up.  The charges are set to go in a specific order -- so that the\\n          building will implode and collapse.  If you *did* defuse one of the\\n          charges, you\\'d fuck up the sequence, and the building might fall the\\n          wrong way.  Why don\\'t you just find a television and watch the party?\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          I\\'m awake.  I have control of the body.  You can\\'t give orders.\\n\\nTYLER\\nI don\\'t have any orders left to give.  It\\'s all set.\\n\\nJack boils over, then cracks.  He drops the gun, falls to his knees and\\nclutches at Tyler.  He touches Tyler\\'s face.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Tyler.  You\\'re real, aren\\'t you?  This is all a big joke, isn\\'t it? \\n          You *are* real, you son of a bitch!\\n\\nTears well up in Jack\\'s eyes.  He hugs Tyler.  Tyler hugs him back.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          We\\'re both real.\\n\\nJack squeezes harder, then lifts his head -- he\\'s hugging ANOTHER JACK.\\n The real Jack gasps, flinches backwards, landing on the gun.  He\\nturns, grabs the gun, and turns back around.  Fifty feet away, Tyler,\\nstanding, leans against a pillar.  He winks.\\n\\nJack raises the gun, turns it around and aims it at his own head.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          There\\'s only one way to stop all this.\\n\\nJack shoves the barrel into his mouth.\\n\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          You better not.  If our body is found dead, the Space Monkeys have\\n          orders to kill Marla.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Marla is gone -- and you don\\'t know where.\\n\\nTyler\\'s hand suddenly DARTS INTO FRAME, CLOSE-UP and SNATCHES the gun.\\n\\nNEW ANGLE\\n\\nTyler, laughing, holding the gun, dashes for the elevator.  Jack\\nsprints after him.\\n\\nINT. ELEVATOR\\n\\nJack manages to leap inside just as the door closes.  He lunges at\\nTyler and fights for the gun.  Tyler, laughing, manages to retain it. \\nThe elevator climbs rapidly -- blinking numbers indicate floors\\nwhizzing past.\\n\\nINT. TOP FLOOR LOBBY\\n\\nThe elevator doors open and the struggling pair whirl out and toward\\nthe GLASS WALLS.  Tyler SHOVES Jack\\'s HEAD against the window, turns it\\nso Jack is looking down.\\n\\nANGLE ON STREET\\n\\nA GREYHOUND BUS sits idling right by the front lobby doors, having been\\nallowed through the cordon.\\n\\nINT. TOP FLOOR LOBBY - RESUMING\\n\\nAs Tyler and Jack continue to stare downward.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          That\\'s ... not the bus.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          You know it is.\\n\\nTyler swings Jack away from the window and shoves him backwards.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          Now, can you grasp that there\\'s nothing you can do?\\n\\nJack raises the gun, aiming at Tyler.  Tyler laughs, but flinches --\\njust as Jack FIRES.  The bullet chews out a CHUNK of the wall.\\n\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          I\\'m not going to kill myself.  I\\'m going to kill *you*.\\n\\nTyler laughs, but he starts rapidly moving down the hallway.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          You can\\'t kill me!  How can you kill me?!\\n\\nJack FIRES again, missing Tyler.  Tyler breaks into a sprint.  Jack\\ndoes the same.\\n\\nINT. HALLWAY\\n\\nJack turns a corner, sees Tyler at the end of the section of hallway,\\nheading for an intersection.  Jack aims the gun at Tyler.  RAPID CUT\\nTO:\\n\\nSECURITY CAMERA POV - HALLWAY\\n\\nJack aims the gun at himself.  RAPID CUT TO:\\n\\nINT. HALLWAY\\n\\nJack FIRES.  As Tyler flinches down -- RAPID CUT TO:\\n\\nSECURITY CAMERA POV - HALLWAY\\n\\n*Jack* flinches down, having shot at himself.  RAPID CUT TO:\\n\\nINT. HALLWAY\\n\\nJack resumes sprinting until he turns a corner to\\n\\nINT. NEW SECTION OF HALLWAY\\n\\nJack sees Tyler turn, freeze, then leap sideways toward a room.  Jack\\nFIRES.  The bullet GRAZES Tyler\\'s leg.  RAPID CUT TO:\\n\\nSECURITY CAMERA POV - HALLWAY\\n\\nJack, with the gun still aimed at his own leg, falls backwards,\\nbleeding from  the graze wound his just gave himself.  RAPID CUT TO:\\n\\nINT. HALLWAY\\n\\nJack pulls himself to his feet, and, his face now looking completely\\ninsane, runs with his limp, holding the gun up, ready to fire.  He\\nturns a corner to --\\n\\n\\nINT. TOP FLOOR LOBBY\\n\\nAnd suddenly, Tyler LEAPS onto Jack.  RAPID CUT TO:\\n\\nSECURITY CAMERA POV - LOBBY\\n\\nJack crumples to the floor and wrestles with himself.  He punches\\nhimself, he tries to trap pin his own arms, he kicks himself.  RAPID\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nINT. TOP FLOOR LOBBY\\n\\nTyler leaps to his feet and dashes away.  Jack pulls himself up and\\nfollows into a --\\n\\nINT. LARGE SOCIAL ROOM\\n\\nWith floor-to-ceiling windows showing a view of the city.  There are a\\nHUNDRED DUFFEL BAGS lining the floor, along the walls.\\n\\nTyler leaps onto Jack seizes the gun.  Jack holds onto Tyler.  Tyler\\nshoves the gun barrel into Jack\\'s mouth.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          Okay -- let\\'s kill you -- let\\'s kill *both* of us.  Be a martyr for the\\n          cause.\\n\\nTyler pushes Jack against a glass wall.  Jack, exhausted, is losing his\\nspirit.\\n\\nJACK (V.O.)\\nI think this is about where we came in.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          Two minutes.\\n\\nJack collapses to the floor.  Tyler moves down with him, keeping the\\ngun in Jack\\'s mouth.  He sits on Jack.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Either way -- the building blows us up or you pull the trigger -- it\\'ll\\n          finally be over.\\n\\n                    TYLER\\n          This building isn\\'t going to blow up.  It\\'s the observation room. \\n          Pay-per-view.  So, what are you going to do?  You don\\'t even have the\\n          guts to make a decision.\\n\\n\\nJack looks into his eyes for a moment, then reaches up and PULLS THE\\nTRIGGER.  *GO TO SLOW MOTION* AS -- KABLAM! his cheeks INFLATE with gas\\nfrom the gun.  His eyes bulge, BLOOD flies out backwards from his head.\\n SMOKE wafts out of his mouth.\\n\\nRESUME NORMAL SPEED as Tyler gapes at Jack, then reaches behind his\\nhead and feels -- there\\'s a HOLE BLOWN OUT THE BACK.  Tyler\\'s eyes\\nglaze over and he falls backwards, plopping on the floor, DEAD, with a\\ngrin on his face.\\n\\nA throng of Space Monkeys -- two of whom drag Marla -- RUSHES into the\\nroom.  They see Jack, ALONE, holding a gun, bleeding profusely from the\\nside of his face, where he\\'s SHOT A HOLE through HIS CHEEK.  He stares\\nat the empty floor in front of him with his weird, little smile.\\n\\nTALL SPACE MONKEY\\nARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SIR?!!\\n\\nThe two Space Monkeys who hold Marla press forward through the crowd. \\nOne of them puts a GUN to her head.  He COCKS it.\\n\\nTALL SPACE MONKEY\\nARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SIR?!!\\n\\nJack takes in the sight of Marla and the gun at her head.  He cracks a\\nTyler-esque grin.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Everything\\'s fine.  Give me the girl.\\n\\nThe Monkeys release Marla.  She moves next to Jack, now becoming more\\nshocked by his bloody state.  Jack grabs her arm.  She digs through her\\npurse and pulls out a wad of tissue paper.  She puts them into his\\nmouth to plug the hole.\\n\\n                    MARLA\\n          What the fuck is going on?!\\n\\nJack cracks his weird, little smile; his eyes are wide and\\nhalf-insane-looking.  He winks at Marla and squeezes her hand.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Tyler\\'s dead.\\n\\nThe Space Monkeys all grab their duffel bags and file out of the room,\\nsaluting Jack as they go.\\n\\nNow, Jack and Marla are completely alone.  He struggles to get to his\\nfeet.  She helps him.  They look out the window.\\n\\n\\nMASSIVE EXPLOSION -- a building a quarter of a mile away.  It\\'s\\ndestruction is completely visible from here.  The glass walls RATTLE\\nLOUDLY from the shock wave.  They both stare out the window.\\n\\n                    JACK\\n          Listen, you met me at a really weird time in my life ...\\n\\nMarla looks at Jack, then looks back out the window.  He reaches for\\nher hand.  She takes his hand.\\n\\nThey are SILHOUETTED against BRIGHT FLASHES as ANOTHER BUILDING\\nEXPLODES and COLLAPSES.  ANOTHER BUILDING EXPLODES.  And ANOTHER\\nBUILDING.  And ANOTHER BUILDING.\\n\\nThe FILM SLOWS DOWN, then ADVANCES ONE FRAME at a TIME -- SHOWING the\\nSPROCKET HOLES on the SIDES.  It\\'s CAUGHT in the mechanism of the\\nprojector\\'s GATE.  EACH FRAME is the EXPLODING BUILDINGS -- then, *ONE\\nFRAME is a PENIS*.  Then, EXPLODING BUILDINGS again.  SPEED UP the\\nframes, LOSE the sprocket holes, RESUME NORMAL SPEED.\\n\\nFADE OUT\\n\\n*THE END*\\n\\n'"
